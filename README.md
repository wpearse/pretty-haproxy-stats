# Motivation

I wanted to put some basic stats from haproxy on a dashboard. I couldn't find
an easy way to do it, so I built my own tool.

# Usage

1. Clone the repo somewhere
2. Change the `settings.haproxy_stats_url` in `index.html` to point to haproxy
3. Load `index.html` in a web browser

# Caveats

I wrote this in half an hour. It's quick and it's dirty, but it works.
